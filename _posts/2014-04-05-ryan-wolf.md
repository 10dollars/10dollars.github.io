#### Who are you and what do you do?

I am Ryan, and I go to an office.

#### What does Is Ryan at the Office do?

Is Ryan at the Office is a novelty domain that says "yes." when I am at work,
and "no." when I am not.


#### How'd you get the idea?

I was using [latitude](https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3001634) to let my
girlfriend know whether I was staying late at work or not. I ragequit latitude
for some reason that I'm sure made a ton of sense at the time, and needed a
replacement.


#### What's it build with?

The server is written in [go](http://golang.org), and runs on [app engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).
You can find the source on [github](http://github.com/thebigbad/novelty.go). Try
resizing the window--what little styling there is is Responsive(tm)(.biz)!

I have [tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
running on my phone. I've asked tasker to tell the server when I get close to
the cell towers by my office (and when I get far from them again).


#### Is there anything you'd like to improve or change?

app engine refuses to serve from a "naked" domain, so a micro ec2 instance I'm
using for some other stuff has to redirect to www.isryanattheoffice.com. I'd
like to get rid of that www. Or add even more w's?

tasker needs internet access in order to talk to the server. In retrospect, it's
obvious that "out of cell range" is a signal that happens when I'm away from
cell towers, so it sometimes fails to update to "no." when I'm on my way home.


#### Has it affected your life in any way? Does your girlfriend check it to see if you're staying late or anything?

Sometimes Thomas sends me a message because Is Ryan at the Office is out of
date. An unexpected bonus of running this site is a personalized push service:
Is Thomas Fiddling Around on a Computer Dot Com.


#### Are you a domain collector? What's the best domain you've got sitting idle right now?

Nope, but something about the "generic" in gTLD has me really excited about
engaging with brands. I believe we are entering a period of domain confusion and
lulz.
