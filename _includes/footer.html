  <p>This is a site maintained by Thomas Dunlap, although the guests do most of the hard work. I had this domain for over a year before I realized I should be using it to show off all the cool side projects I love. Waferbaby's site was basically everything I wanted mine to be, so I lifted it. Hard.</p>
