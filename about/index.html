<h2>About</h2>
<p>First thing's first. This site is heavily indebted to <a href="https://twitter.com/waferbaby">Daniel Bogan</a>, whom I've never met, but who was generous enough to post <a href="https://github.com/waferbaby/usesthis">the code</a> for his interview site, <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>, on GitHub.</p>

<p> Okay, onward. My name is Thomas Dunlap, and I'm a designer and <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/ms">HCDE masters</a> student living in Seattle, WA. I Had 10 Dollars started as a <a href="https://twitter.com/spladow/statuses/325064162009051136">joke I made on Twitter</a> about the domain ihadtendollars.com being the most descriptive name for most of the sites I'd make. Basically, meaning that I register domains just because they sound funny and then I try to figure out what to do with them. As soon as I made the joke I registered ihadtendollars.com. Of course, it just sat gathering dust for over a year before I figured out that I wanted to use it to show off side projects that my friends and other awesome people were making. </p>

<p>I love weird little projects and single serving sites. Niche communities and projects designed to scratch their creator's peculiar itch. I'm not exactly sure what this site will be yet, but I know I want it to be a place where a small in joke can have a home next to a relatively big project that could make a go at being a full time gig for a crafty developer. The web is a <a href+"http://torrez.org/how-about-some-fucking-whimsy.html">delightful place full of whimsy,</a> and I'd like to shine a light on that.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can always reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/spladow">Twitter</a>. I also answer email at whatscene@gmail.com. Feel free to send me cool projects I should know about. :)</p>
